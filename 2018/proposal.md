PyCon AU 2018 Education Seminar Proposal
========================================

If accepted, the PyCon Australia Education Seminar will bring together educators who are using Python
in teaching or looking for new ways to use coding in education. The goal is to share stories, strategies
and techniques for engaging students and teaching with Python that can be directly applied by other educators. 

Python has long had reputation as an effective beginner programming language. Bringing together educators and
developers helps developers provide better support for beginners in Python and its libraries, as well as
giving educators the opportunity to develop their own technical skills further.

As in previous years, talk topics at the seminar will be open to any educational use of Python but the core
focus will continue to be on primary and secondary school education. This includes both formal classroom
instruction and extracurricular activities.

However, some changes and additions are also being proposed based on our experiences with previous iterations
of the event.

Event Organisers
----------------

* Nick Coghlan
  * 2015 Education Seminar founder & coordinator
  * 2016/17 Education Seminar co-coordinator with Katie Bell
  * CPython core developer

* Dr Nicky Ringland
  * Computing Education Specialist at the Australian Computing Academy
  * Outreach Officer at the National Computer Science School
  * Co-founder of Grok Learning

* Additional organisers:
  * Amanda Hogan (Australian Computing Academy)
  * Bruce Fuda (Australian Computing Academy)

Event Outline
-------------

Prior to the afternoon tea break, the 2018 Education Seminar will follow the same
structure as in previous years: an invited speaker prior to morning tea, 3 speakers
from the Call for Proposals prior to lunch, then 3 more speakers prior to afternoon
tea.

For the final session, we'd like to work with the main conference organisers to
arrange to run a "Student Showcase", inspired by the well-received student
presentations at PyCon Australia 2017.

The general idea of this part of the proposal would be to:

* Provide a way for teachers & senior secondary students to nominate as potential
  presenters at the Showcase (similar to the way Gungahlin College students did
  through the regular CfP for 2017)
* Accept up to 6 projects for presentation (these would each be given a 15 minute
  presentation slot *without* any question & answer time, and a ~5 minute break
  in between slots. Moving back and forth between the Student Showcase and the other
  specialist tracks would generally be discouraged)
* Work with the conference organisers to provide a way for teachers, family members,
  and students to attend just the showcase session for a relatively nominal cost
  (e.g. $15)

Note that while in 2017 there was some question as to whether PyCon Australia
volunteer organisers needed to apply for and receive the appropriate state credentials
for working with children due to some speakers and volunteers being under 18, adding
the Student Showcase to the program would make this requirement unambiguous:
since the Student Showcase would be intended specifically for high school students,
the Education Seminar organisers and volunteers and the main conference organisers
would definitely need those approvals in place. Organisers of other specialist tracks
may not need them, but it would likely be simpler to make it a general requirement
for all volunteers at the event.

If the Student Showcase idea doesn't work out, then our mostly likely fallback plan
would be to accept 3 more speakers from the Call for Proposals.

Additional Events
-----------------

Assuming that the 2018 conference once again includes a tutorial day on Thursday,
we'd like to organise a formal teacher training workshop for that day (in collaboration
with the Australian Computing Academy).

The exact details of such a workshop (including whether or not it would actually be
run at the conference tutorial venue, or in another location as an associated event)
would be figured out closer to the conference.

Financial Aid
-------------

We know from past experience that the Education Seminar tends to receive
a higher proportion of financial aid requests than is typical for other
specialist tracks or the main conference.

As happened in 2017, the organisers have secured a commitment of up to
AU$5k in "if needed" financial aid funding specifically for speakers at
the Education Seminar. These funds weren't actually needed in 2017 (as
the conference's registration & sponsorship revenue proved sufficient to
cover all financial aid requests), but the contingency fund still helps
manage the risk of allocating financial aid prior to the exact amount
of registration and sponsorship revenue being known.
